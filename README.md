# Derived

An app made by Android Studios primarily designed to read and download web novels from online.
Not intended to used for content that is violating copyright infringement laws.


This project was mainly for personal usage/as a personal project, so updates will be infrequent as I am currently a college student.

DERIVED is a Android application utilizing Android Studios primarily using Kotlin.
The planned method of extracting web novel is similar to Tachiyomi with website scrapers that are specific to each website.

The aim of DERIVED as my personal project is:
1. Ability to import and export custom web scrapers (.py is the format I am familiar with) alongisde importing/exporting websites to read off of
2. Able to keep past histories of a website in case if the website code is updated rendering the present scraper useless
3. Be able to MTL on its own
